If you want to run the Access Control section, run UserAuthorization and ApiGetWay after running the Platform section with docker. remember to run Redis and the user database, the exact name and password can be found in the UserAuthorization and ApiGetWay in the appsettings.json section, feel free to change them. Make sure your frontend uses the gateway ip (5025) for login authentication and permission verification.
